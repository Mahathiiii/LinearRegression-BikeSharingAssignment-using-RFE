# BoomBikes Sharing - Multiple Linear Regression Assignment with RFE and MinMax Scaling

# Introduction:

Welcome to the BoomBikes sharing project! In this assignment, our objective is to develop a robust multiple linear regression model that accurately predicts the demand for shared bikes. This model will provide valuable insights to BoomBikes, helping them navigate the American market post-lockdown by identifying and understanding the key factors that influence bike demand.
BoomBikes, a US-based bike-sharing provider, has recently experienced a significant decline in revenues. To address this issue, they have enlisted the help of a consulting firm to analyze and identify the key factors influencing the demand for shared bikes in the American market. BoomBikes is particularly interested in understanding:
Which variables are critical in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
The extent to which these variables explain the fluctuations in bike demand.
By gaining insights into these factors, BoomBikes aims to better anticipate customer needs and enhance their service offerings to improve revenue and market position.

# Problem Statement:

BoomBikes, a US-based bike-sharing provider, has recently experienced a significant decline in revenues. To address this issue, they have enlisted the help of a consulting firm to analyze and identify the key factors influencing the demand for shared bikes in the American market. BoomBikes is particularly interested in understanding:

1. Which variables are critical in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
2. The extent to which these variables explain the fluctuations in bike demand.
By gaining insights into these factors, BoomBikes aims to better anticipate customer needs and enhance their service offerings to improve revenue and market position.

# Business goal:

The project aims to model bike demand using available independent variables. This will enable BoomBikes to:

1. Predict bike demand based on different features.
2. Optimize business strategies to meet customer expectations and market demands.
3. Gain insights into demand dynamics for potential market expansion.

# Data description:

The dataset provided encompasses daily bike demand data along with several independent variables that are believed to impact this demand. Here is an overview of the key features included in the dataset:

1. Feature 1: Description of feature 1.
2. Feature 2: Description of feature 2.
3. ...
4. Feature n: Description of feature n.

These features collectively contribute to understanding the dynamics of bike demand, enabling us to build a predictive model that BoomBikes can leverage to optimize their business strategies post-lockdown.

# Approach:

## Data Preprocessing:

1. Handle missing values: Check for any missing data in the dataset and apply appropriate techniques such as imputation or removal based on the context and impact on the analysis.

2. Encode categorical variables if necessary: Convert categorical variables into numerical representations using techniques like one-hot encoding to facilitate their inclusion in the regression model.

3. Scale numerical variables using MinMax scaling: Normalize numerical variables to a common scale (usually between 0 and 1) to prevent any single variable from dominating the model due to its larger scale.

## Feature Selection:

1. Use Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to select significant features for the model: RFE iteratively removes less significant features from the model and evaluates its performance until the optimal set of features is identified.

## Model Building:

1. Build a multiple linear regression model using selected features: Construct a linear regression model using the features identified through RFE to predict bike demand based on their respective coefficients.

2. Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics: Assess the model's accuracy and reliability using metrics such as R-squared, adjusted R-squared, and root mean squared error (RMSE) to gauge how well it predicts actual bike demand.

## Model Interpretation:

1. Interpret the coefficients of the model to understand the impact of each feature on bike demand: Analyze the sign and magnitude of coefficients to determine which features have the strongest influence on bike demand, whether positively or negatively.

By following this structured approach, we aim to develop a robust multiple linear regression model that provides actionable insights into the factors driving bike demand for BoomBikes post-lockdown.


# Implementation:

The project will be executed in a Jupyter notebook using Python. Below is a high-level outline of the notebook structure:

1. Data Loading and Exploration:
   - Load the dataset containing daily bike demand data and independent variables.
   - Explore the dataset to understand its structure, dimensions, and initial insights.
   - Perform descriptive statistics to summarize the dataset's central tendencies and distributions.
   - Visualize key features and relationships using plots such as histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps.

2. Data Preprocessing:
   - Handle missing values: Impute missing data or drop rows/columns as necessary.
   - Encode categorical variables: Convert categorical variables into numerical representations (if required) using techniques like one-hot encoding.
   - Scale numerical variables: Apply MinMax scaling to normalize numerical features to a consistent range (typically between 0 and 1).

3. Feature Selection using RFE (Recursive Feature Elimination):
   - Implement RFE with a linear regression model to select the most significant features for predicting bike demand.
   - Iteratively eliminate less impactful features until the optimal set of features is determined.

4. Model Building and Evaluation:
   - Build a multiple linear regression model using the selected features from RFE.
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets to train the model on the training set and evaluate its performance on the test set.
   - Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as R-squared, adjusted R-squared, and RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error).
   - Visualize the actual vs. predicted values to assess the model's accuracy and identify any patterns or discrepancies.

5. Conclusion and Recommendations:
   - Interpret the coefficients of the model to understand the impact of each feature on bike demand.
   - Summarize key findings from the analysis and provide actionable recommendations based on the model's insights.
   - Discuss limitations and potential areas for further exploration or improvement in future iterations.

By following this structured approach, the Jupyter notebook will guide the step-by-step implementation of the multiple linear regression model for predicting bike demand, ensuring clarity and reproducibility in the analysis process.


# Conclusion:


Upon completion of this project, our objective is to equip BoomBikes with actionable insights into the factors influencing bike demand in the American market post-lockdown. These insights will serve as a foundation for devising strategic initiatives aimed at strengthening BoomBikes' market position and profitability.
Through comprehensive data analysis and modeling techniques, we have explored how various independent variables interact with bike demand. By leveraging advanced statistical methods and machine learning algorithms, we have identified key predictors that significantly impact the number of bike rentals on a daily basis. 
Our findings highlight critical trends and patterns, enabling BoomBikes to make informed decisions regarding inventory management, marketing campaigns, and operational strategies. By understanding customer preferences and environmental factors affecting bike usage, BoomBikes can optimize resource allocation and enhance customer satisfaction.
In conclusion, this project not only enhances our understanding of bike sharing dynamics but also empowers BoomBikes to adapt proactively to market changes and capitalize on emerging opportunities in the post-lockdown era.
